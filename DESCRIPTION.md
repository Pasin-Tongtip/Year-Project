Project Overview
It’s a mathematical + snake game. The game will provide an equation for the player and there will be a character (our snake) that will move like the original snake game. There will be more than one food. In every food there will be a different number in the food. The objective is to solve the equation and when you get the answer, you’ve to move the snake to eat the food with the right answer. If your answer is wrong, the health bar will decrease. And when the health bar is empty, you’ll lose the game. When the snake hits the border, it will appear on the other side and when the snake eats itself, its health will decrease.

Game Concept
A mathematical fuse with the snake game.
On the top of the screen, there will be a section for displaying the health bar, score, equation.
Our character can move up, down, left, right. It can eat food just like the original game but when it eats, it won’t grow. 
The food will be more than one. Each one will have a number inside and only one of them will be the answer for the equation.
If you eat the wrong answer or eat yourself, the health bar will decrease.
If you eat the correct answer, the score will go up.
If the health bar is empty, the game will stop and display your score, then it will ask you if you want to play again or not.
